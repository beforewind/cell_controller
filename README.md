# Cell controller

This is a not-so-originally named application for controlling multiple instruments in cell microfluidic experiments. A suspension of cells in KCl solution is driven through a microfluidic channel by an external syringe pump. When a cell entering the microfluidic portion of a chip is detected via resistive pulse (or [Coulter counter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulter_counter)) technique, the syringe is reversed so that the cell begins to change direction after passing through the channel. At the same time, an external camera (Phantom v7 high-speed camera, [Vision Research](https://www.phantomhighspeed.com/)) is triggered to record the passage. Cells can be driven through the sensing region of the device multiple times to get good measurement statistics.
